# Homebrew formula for itero-ai, the local model's server itero starts:
# installs the release archives (made by `make dist-ai`, checked by their
# SHA-256), not a build from source. Its own formula, so a user with no
# model never downloads llama.cpp. The release workflow's tap job writes
# the version and the four checksums into the tap's copy; the zeros here
# are placeholders for that.
